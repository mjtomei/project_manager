title: CLI Recording
description: Capture an asciinema replay of one or more CLI commands
---

## When to use

A scenario demonstrates a command-line interaction — argument
handling, stdout/stderr, multi-step CLI sequences — and you want
unambiguous evidence of what happened, consumable by humans (replay)
and downstream agents (parse the cast). Use this recipe
when there's no TUI involved; for tmux-hosted TUIs, use
`tmux-screen-recording.md`.

## What this recipe produces

Write into `<capture-dir>/<short-name>/` (the scenario prompt
substitutes the actual captures directory for `<capture-dir>`):

- `recording.cast` — asciinema replay (`asciinema play recording.cast`).
- `recording.mp4` — H.264 video rendered from the cast (**required**).
  This is the embeddable view: the sign-off HTML report shows it inline
  via a plain `<video controls>` element — native pause / scrub, no
  player library, works offline. H.264/mp4 plays everywhere including
  iOS Safari (VP8/VP9 webm does not decode on iOS). The `.cast` stays
  as the small, exact-replay/grep source.
- `manifest.md` — frontmatter + prose: workdir, the exact command(s)
  recorded, what the recording demonstrates, pre/post-fix state if
  relevant. Include a `## Files` section listing every non-default
  file the capture produced with a one-line description each.

## Capture

### One command, end-to-end

```
asciinema rec <capture-dir>/<short-name>/recording.cast \
    -c '<the-cli-command-with-args>'
```

The recording starts when the command starts, stops when it exits.
Cleanest shape — no shell prompt noise.

### Multiple commands, manually driven

```
asciinema rec <capture-dir>/<short-name>/recording.cast -c bash
# at the prompt: type each command, then `exit` to stop
```

Fine when a human is at a terminal. The recording will include the
shell prompt and any typing pauses.

### Multiple commands, scripted

```
asciinema rec <capture-dir>/<short-name>/recording.cast \
    -c 'bash -c "set -x; cmd-one; cmd-two; cmd-three"'
```

`set -x` echoes each command before it runs so the recording (and
any downstream parser) sees each command alongside its output. No
shell prompt, no manual driving.

### No-TTY environments (e.g. automated agents)

Same workaround as the tmux-screen-recording recipe: asciinema needs
a TTY, so run it inside a tmux pane (which has one). Unlike a TUI
capture, you do **not** need a `tmux attach` — the pane itself is
where the CLI runs.

```
# 1. Scaffold tmux on its own socket and open one pane.
tmux -L scaffold new-session -d -s rec -x 100 -y 30

# 2. Start asciinema in the pane, wrapping whichever command form
#    fits from above (one command, bash + manual, or bash -c script).
tmux -L scaffold send-keys -t rec:0.0 \
    "asciinema rec --quiet --overwrite <capture-dir>/recording.cast \
        -c '<command-to-record>'" Enter

# 3. If you wrapped `bash`, drive it from outside via tmux send-keys
#    on the same scaffold socket; if you wrapped a single command or
#    a `bash -c` script, just wait for it to finish.

# 4. Stop: have the recorded process exit (it'll flush the cast),
#    or `pkill -TERM -f 'asciinema rec.*<capture-dir>'`.
tmux -L scaffold kill-server   # cleanup
```

If `asciinema` isn't installed and can't be installed, fall back to
appending `| tee transcript.log` to the command line — you lose
animation but keep the output. Note the fallback in the manifest.

## Render to video

Once the cast exists, render a `.mp4` sibling so the recording embeds
in the sign-off HTML report as a `<video controls>` element. `agg`
renders the cast to frames (GIF), then `ffmpeg` encodes H.264 — there is
no single cast→video tool worth using (the dedicated ones are orders of
magnitude slower and fragile). The intermediate GIF is discarded.

```
cast=<capture-dir>/<short-name>/recording.cast
agg --idle-time-limit 2 "$cast" "$cast.gif"
# 2x nearest-neighbor upscale for crisp text — but only while the result
# stays within iOS hardware-decode limits (4096x2304, H.264 level 5.1).
# A terminal large enough to blow that budget is already crisp at native
# size; then just round dimensions down to even (H.264 requires even).
vf="scale=iw*2:ih*2:flags=neighbor"
read -r gw gh < <(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
    -show_entries stream=width,height -of 'csv=p=0:s= ' "$cast.gif")
if [ "$((gw * 2))" -gt 4096 ] || [ "$((gh * 2))" -gt 2304 ]; then
    vf="scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2"
fi
ffmpeg -y -i "$cast.gif" -vf "$vf" \
    -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level:v 5.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 18 \
    -movflags +faststart "${cast%.cast}.mp4"
rm -f "$cast.gif"
```

Notes:
- `--idle-time-limit 2` caps the long pauses a terminal session
  accumulates, dropping dead air without losing anything worth watching.
- H.264 + `yuv420p` is the only combination that decodes everywhere,
  including iOS Safari (VP8/VP9 webm and 4:4:4 chroma do not). 4:2:0
  chroma subsampling would blur colored terminal text at native size,
  so the nearest-neighbor upscale renders at 2x — crisp text, and the
  doubling guarantees the even dimensions H.264 requires. The size
  guard matters: an unconditional 2x on a large terminal produces a
  video past level 5.1 (e.g. 4276x2284), which desktop browsers play
  but iPhone/iPad hardware decoders silently refuse. `crf 18` is
  visually lossless for this content; favor
  quality — file size is not a concern. `-movflags +faststart` puts the
  moov atom up front so playback starts before the full download.
  A long, busy session may take several minutes to encode; that's
  expected and acceptable for a rare case.
