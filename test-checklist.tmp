Manual Test Checklist — PR #67: Miscellaneous TUI fixes and UX improvements
=============================================================================

X. Enter key triggers edit (not detail panel)
   - Select a PR in the tech tree
   - Press Enter
   - Expected: opens an editor pane (same as pressing 'e'), NOT a detail side panel

2. Rebalance / mobile mode for non-default windows
   - Open a non-main tmux window (e.g. start a PR, which opens a review window)
   - Press 'b' to rebalance in the main TUI
   - On a narrow terminal (<120 cols), verify mobile mode zoom still works
   - Expected: layout rebalances correctly, mobile zoom activates when appropriate

3. pr start prompt mentions TUI for done
   - Press 's' to start a PR
   - Check the Claude prompt in the new window
   - Expected: workflow section says "press d in the TUI or run pm pr done ... from the base pm directory (not from this workdir)"

X. Plans pane width
   - Press 'P' to open the plans view
   - Expected: plans fill the full width of the terminal, not a narrow sliver

X. Command bar placeholder
   - Look at the bottom command bar when it is NOT focused
   - Expected: shows "press / to type a command"
   - Press '/' to focus the command bar
   - Expected: placeholder changes to "Type command (e.g. pr start pr-001)..."
   - Press Esc to unfocus
   - Expected: placeholder reverts to "press / to type a command"

6. Review window diff pane persists after quitting pager
   - Press 'd' on an in_progress PR to mark it done and open the review window
   - In the diff pane (right side), press 'q' to quit the less pager
   - Expected: pane stays open as an interactive shell cd'd into the PR workdir
   - Verify you can run git commands, edit files, etc. in that shell
   (Also: plan view panes now persist after less — press 'v' and quit less)

7. ? in help menu opens discussion pane
   - Press '?' to open the help screen
   - Expected: footer says "Press Esc to close  |  ? to discuss pm with Claude"
   - Press '?' again
   - Expected: help closes and a Claude pane opens focused on explaining pm

8. Split direction based on window aspect ratio
   - In a tall/narrow terminal (height*2 > width in characters), press 'e' or 'c'
   - Expected: new pane splits vertically (top/bottom), not horizontally (side-by-side)
   - In a wide terminal, press 'e' or 'c'
   - Expected: new pane splits horizontally (side-by-side)

9. All PR commands accept GitHub PR numbers
   - Run: pm pr done 67        (bare number)
   - Run: pm pr done '#67'     (with # prefix — quote the # in shell)
   - Run: pm pr edit 67
   - Run: pm pr select 67
   - Run: pm pr start 67
   - Run: pm pr close 67
   - Expected: each resolves to the PR with gh_pr_number=67
   - Run: pm pr done 99999
   - Expected: "PR '99999' not found." with available PRs listed as #N format
